# SocialTimelineBuilder
Social Network that allows you to compare the timeline of you and your friends postes (in a future update).
Made using Vue.js for the frondend, Spring Boot Java for the backend, and PHPmyadmin for the SQL database.
Note that this social network was a challenge, current version is made in a week and it was my first experience with Vue and Spring Boot.
On the other side I already knew SQL, PHPmyadmin.
I'm still trying to port the project to Docker.
Note also that with a so short deadline, the website design is minimal.
